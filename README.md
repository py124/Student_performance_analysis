# Student Performance Analysis  

This project analyzes student performance data, focusing on data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset provides insights into study habits, gender distribution, and other factors influencing student performance.

**Interpretation:**  
- GPA varies slightly across grade classes.  
- Students in **Grade Class 0 and 3** have the highest GPA (~4.0).  
- **Grade Class 1 and 2** show slightly lower GPA (around 3.6), which may indicate differences in academic difficulty or student performance.  
- Overall, most grade classes maintain a **high GPA close to 4.0**.

  **Interpretation:**  
- There is a **slight positive correlation** between weekly study time and GPA.  
- The regression line (in red) indicates that **increasing study hours generally leads to higher GPA**, though the relationship is not very strong.  
- The green dots (Actual) show some variability, meaning other factors besides study time also affect GPA.
